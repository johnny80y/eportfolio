								<h3></h3>


								<p>Given the bleak picture painted by Saxena (2021) and Yldrim (2020), it appears that the Data Science profession is on the decline. Automation will lead to fewer jobs and those jobs remaining, will have astronomical qualification requirements. Nonetheless, most discussion participants argued that data scientists will continue to be needed in the future.</p>

								<p>My starting argument concerned ethics. As AI can (re)produce biases (Zou & Schiebinger, 2018), humans must retain ultimate control. This view was complemented by a fellow student, who pointed out that, according to Hidalgo (2021), people generally trust humans over machines. Unfortunately, this is not true in all circumstances. Lakkaraju and Bastani (2020) have demonstrated that people are easily tricked into trusting flawed AI. So, there remains the caveat that trust can be manipulated. </p>

								<p>Another student approached the issue of biased AI from a different direction, proposing to use better training data. Unfortunately, poor data management and GDPR restrictions (e.g. on the type and longevity of stored data) impact the availability of high-quality data. Luckily, proper Master Data Management may help to address the former issue (Profisee, 2021), while anonymization is one way to address the latter (GDPR Recital 26). </p>

								<p> Overall, data scientists must adapt to automation, ethical challenges, qualification demands, and more. Knowing how to ask the right questions is key (Goyal et al., 2020) – especially in such complex circumstances. Taken together, these factors imply that data scientists continue to be necessary, though they have to navigate an increasingly complex technical and legal landscape. Data Lifecycle Management (IBM, N.D.) and similar frameworks can help them to structure projects. They are, however, only a tool and not a solution in themselves. Thus, all discussion participants agreed that we will continue to need well-trained data scientists to plan, execute and evaluate projects to create social and economic value from data.</p>
