									<h3>Reflection on Group Project #1</h3>
									(15 April 2023)
								</p>	
								<p>
									Our second group assignment involved writing an executive summary report. The previous report detailed our design for a database system in the food delivery sector. This time, we were asked to describe the implementation process and the completed system. Therefore, the perspective and the topics we would write about were very different. Rather than evaluating concepts and design choices, we were now pretending to have implemented a previously designed system in a “real” enterprise setting.
								</p>
								<p>
									My partner and I had our first video call about three weeks before the deadline. I prepared for the call by writing a report outline and implementing our previously designed database in SQLite. I had also written a few paragraphs about testing this prototype database. As with the previous report, my partner and I played to our respective strengths. She is very skilled in thinking about business needs and she knows a lot about compliance and the UK legal framework. For that reason, she focused on the compliance and business aspects of the report. I, on the other hand, am more technically skilled and focused on the technical aspects of our project.
								</p>
								<p>
									Using a shared Google Doc, we both collaborated evenly and fairly on the report. As we had worked together previously and had established a relationship of trust, there was no need for formal agreements. We had several video calls to discuss the direction our report should take but there was no need for meeting notes. Every evening, we reviewed each other’s work, made edits, and raised suggestions and/or questions. This way, we both contributed our respective strengths while still collaborating on all parts of the report.
								</p>
								<p>
									We tried to incorporate the feedback we had received on the previous report into this project. For this reason, we placed a major focus on reflecting the pros and cons of the various choices we had made. For example, we reflected on the advantages and disadvantages of MySQL versus MongoDB, which our professor had mentioned in the last seminar session. Additionally, we tried to narrow our focus and not talk about topics that were not strictly related to the project at hand. For example, we decided not to discuss information security frameworks such as ISO27001 as this is not primarily related to a database project but to a company’s overall security posture. We made this decision as the feedback on our previous report included criticism for including unnecessary topics. We would have valued more specificity though as we had based the first report’s structure on the database system development lifecycle (Connolly & Begg, 2014) but the feedback did not tell us which paragraphs had been deemed unnecessary.
								</p>
								<p>
									Despite a disappointing first grade, the overall experience with the group projects was positive and educational. We learned a lot about the design and implementation of databases and weighed the advantages and disadvantages of various approaches. As my partner and I worked together very well, there was no freeriding and I honestly have nothing negative to say about the collaboration and task sharing.

									<h3>End of Module Reflection</h3>
									(15 April 2023)
									<br>1062 Words
								</p>	
								<p>
									Going into this module, I expected to learn techniques of processing and analyzing Big Data. I have a background in statistics and data analytics, so I was already very familiar with many of the module’s contents, including data wrangling and web scraping. The main skills I ended up learning were the design and implementation of relational databases. The following paragraphs reflect a selection of the module’s core activities and topics.
								</p>
								<p>
									<b>Data Wrangling and Web Scraping</b>
								</p>
								<p>
									I had not anticipated that data wrangling would be such a major part of the module, which admittedly disappointed me. It meant that I spent weeks merely revising material I already knew. In hindsight, I believe that the disappointment I felt was due to my excessive expectations as the module is geared toward people with fewer prior experiences. Nonetheless, repetition is an effective tool for learning (Teninbaum, 2017) and this applies not only to learning facts but also to learning practical tasks (Lynch & Maclean, 2000). As data activities require both factual knowledge and applied practice, I still feel like I drew some benefit from these parts of the module.
								</p>
								<p>
									<b>Database Design and Implementation</b>
								</p>
								<p>
									Other major topics covered by the module included the design and implementation of relational databases. I loved learning how to design, normalize, and implement relational databases as described by Connolly and Begg (2014). These are some of the core skills any data scientist must master (Desai, 2020) and they are in high demand on the job market (UC Berkley, 2022). Properly working with SQL databases involves much more than writing queries and especially unit nine was very helpful in this regard. For example, I learned that relational databases must be populated in a specific order to prevent errors caused by foreign key constraints. This helps to maintain referential integrity (Microsoft, 2023). 
								</p>
								<p>
									Our professor also pointed us to MongoDB, a NoSQL alternative database management system (DBMS). Relational databases use a rigid structure. Among other things, this prevents duplicate data but it also makes queries run slower (MongoDB, 2023; Precia, 2020). NoSQL alternatives, on the other hand, offer more flexibility and easier scaling but they may also requite more storage space (MongoDB, 2023). Touching on more recent developments in DBMSs was fantastic and it made the curriculum more relevant to today’s job market. At the same time, I wish we had had the time to learn about designing and implementing NoSQL databases.
								</p>
								<p>
									<b>Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)</b>
								</p>
								<p>
									We learned about many theoretical API concepts but, similarly to NoSQL databases, were not given the time to practice using them. We did, however, learn that APIs are vital interfaces for interacting with systems and that the majority of the world’s internet traffic consists of API interactions (Akamai, 2021). Unfortunately, this also makes APIs a frequent target for attackers (ibid.), which is why we learned about securing APIs. The latter can be done, for example, by following the Open Worldwide Application Security Project’s API security guidelines (OWASP, 2019).
								</p>
								<p>
									As most API risks concern externally exposed interfaces, internal API systems are comparatively more secure. Thus, I plan to integrate APIs more into my professional work in cybersecurity. For example, my organization internally uses a number of distinct knowledge platforms. Thanks to the concepts and skills I learned in this module, I will set up a MongoDB database that collects all of this dispersed, semi-structured information using API calls and then provides a centralized knowledge pool. This project would not be possible without my understanding of APIs, and evaluating SQL versus NoSQL databases.
								</p>
								<p>
									<b>Group Projects</b>
								</p>
								<p>
									The group projects added additional educational value to the module by allowing me to closely collaborate with a skilled and motivated partner. As we both brought very different skills and experiences to the table, we mutually benefitted from working together. Being more technically savvy than my partner, I worked on most of the technical aspects of our database’s design and implementation. My partner, on the other hand, had more business expertise and contributed by focusing on the business aspects of our project. 
								</p>
								<p>
									Research has shown that group projects improve learning but students are strongly advised to “know who you’re working with before you commit yourself to any group” (Nordberg, 2008:491). This recommendation proved valuable in our case as my partner and I knew and trusted each other from previous modules, Therefore, we were able to collaborate fairly and effectively through a series of video calls without the need for any formal agreements or meeting notes. Still, the potential for dysfunctional group work (Hall & Buzzwell, 2012), was also demonstrated in the module as not all students equally and punctually participated in the non-graded collaborative discussion activities. This delayed discussions and made them less engaging overall.
								</p>
								<p>
									The experience of designing and implementing a database in a startup/business context complemented the module’s theoretical lessons with some more practical experiences. My partner and I discussed various DBMSs, programming languages, and web hosting solutions. Weighing the pros and cons of these options for our particular business use case, we jointly decided on the optimal way forward for our company. In doing so, we both learned a lot from this project and each other.
								</p>
								<p>
									<b>Conclusion</b>
								</p>
								<p>
									This module covered a wide range of topics related to data wrangling, web scraping, APIs, and relational databases. A number of coding exercises and group projects helped us to practically apply many of the theoretical concepts we engaged with. Yet, I would have liked to see more opportunity for hands-on exercises, especially relating to NoSQL databases and APIs. While a strong theoretical foundation is essential for any higher academic program, practice is equally important (Wrenn & Wrenn, 2009). For this reason, I would argue that the module is great as a starting point but that additional work on the side is necessary to obtain the full educational benefit from the topics covered. 
								</p>
								<p>
									Overall, I managed to learn a lot about different types of databases and the pros and cons of different DBMSs. I also obtained theoretical insights into APIs and revised data wrangling and web scraping. The group projects taught me the foundations of implementing a database project in a business context and I learned a lot from our professor and my group partner. All of these skills will be very beneficial to my current role in cybersecurity and a few projects have already been started as a result of the knowledge I gained in this module.
