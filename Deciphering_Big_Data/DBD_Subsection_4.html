									<h3>Reflection on Group Project #1</h3>
									(28 February 2023)
								</p>	
								
								<p>
									Designing a database and thinking about its implementation using the database system development lifecycle (Connolly & Begg, 2014) allowed my partner and me to understand the importance of well-designed databases that integrate well with a company’s applications, and that enable efficient operations/business processes. For our assignment, we designed a relational MySQL database for a fictional food delivery startup called FoodTaxi.
								</p>
								<p>
									The database development lifecycle gave us a step-by-step process that we could follow in our design phase. We started by gathering requirements and analyzing the different user groups. We also identified data entities, relationships, and attributes that will comprise the database. In doing so, we developed a deep understanding of the data we would be working with, which taught us how it could be organized within the database.
								</p>
								<p>
									Our next step was the actual database design, where we created a logical data model that captured the relationships between tables. Building on this, we started with the physical database design and translated the conceptual data model into a schema with pre-defined data types. This process required a deep understanding of the database and the relationships we wanted to implement.
								</p>
								<p>
									After completing the physical model, we were able to imagine how data would be entered, stored, and accessed, which would become relevant in the next lifecycle step – implementation. Thus, we wrote a strategy for the database implementation, where we described how we would create and fill the different tables and relationships. This, we decided, would best be done using Python scripts that enable us to work seamlessly with MySQL. In addition, Python would work well with the user-facing applications FoodTaxi will be using. This way, we hope to ensure that the database will be efficient and functional.
								</p>
								<p>
									Our group consisted of two people and we knew and trusted each other from previous seminars. Thus, we did not require or take meeting notes. Through a series of video calls and a shared Google Doc, we collected the assignment requirements and distributed the work among earth other. As I am more technically focused, I mostly contributed to the technical design and specifications of the database. My partner contributed mostly to the business aspects and the user requirements. We both worked on the database diagram together. Overall, the collaboration with my team partner worked very well and both sides were able to contribute in accordance with their particular strengths.
								</p>
								<p>
									In conclusion, the project of designing a database using the database system development lifecycle was a challenging but interesting experience. It provided us with insights into the design of backend systems and databases. The project allowed us to apply our theoretical knowledge in a more practical setting and thereby develop skills that will likely be very useful for this module and beyond. The collaboration with my partner was pleasant and balanced.

									<h3>Data Normalization Task</h3>
									(04 March 2023)
								</p>	
								
								<p>
									This week’s task is to normalize a given excel spreadsheet to the third normal form. We normalize data to “identify a suitable set of relations that support the data requirements of an enterprise” (Connolly & Begg, 2014: 452). Such relations are characterized by three factors that make maintaining and storing a database more efficient. These factors are described by Connolly and Begg (2014): First, we use the “minimal number of attributes”. Second, attributes that belong together logically are also tied together in the database. Third, there is as little redundancy as possible.
								</p>
								<p>
									The unnormalized table we are given to work with looks as follows:
								</p>
								<center>
									<img src="../images/1_normalization.png" alt="Graph 2" style="height:360px">
								</center>
								<br>
								<p>
									<b>First Normal Form</b><br>
									<i>“A relation in which the intersection of each row and column contains one and only one value.” (Connolly & Begg, 2014: 466)</i>
								</p>
								<p>
									The primary key in this table is “Student Number”. Our task is to make sure that every cell holds an atomic value. According to the lecturecast (University of Essex 2023), this means that there must not be more than one value per intersection of rows and columns. In this table, every student has several subjects that share the same position in the table. After fixing this, the table looks as follows:
								</p>
								<center>
									<img src="../images/2_normalization.png" alt="Graph 2" style="height:360px">
								</center>
								<br>
								<p>
									Note that the Student Number is no longer unique, so it cannot serve as the primary key anymore. For this table, a composite key made up of Student Number and Course Name would make sense. Note that this system would not work if students are able to take the same class twice because then uniqueness is not guaranteed. In that case, a semester column would need to be added to the table or an auto-incrementing counter could be used as a key.
								</p>
								<p>
									For this exercise, it suffices to use a composite key made up of Student Number and Course Name, so I will continue with this simplification.
								</p>
								<p>
									<b>Second Normal Form</b><br>
									<i>“A relation that is in first normal form and every non-primary-key attribute is fully functionally dependent on the primary key.” (Connolly & Begg, 2014: 470)</i>
								</p>
								<p>
									The table above contains a lot of repeating values. The second normal form requires us to remove redundancies. Thus, we can split the table up into three separate tables. The COURSES table contains all information on the different courses students may enroll in and uses the Course Name as the primary key. Again this is a simplification because courses may be repeated with different teachers in later semesters. However, for this exercise, this level of granularity is sufficient.
								</p>
								<center>
									<img src="../images/3_normalization.png" alt="Graph 2" style="height:360px">
								</center>
								<br>
								<p>
									The STUDENTS table contains all information on the individual students and uses Student Number as the primary key:
								</p>
								</p>
								<center>
									<img src="../images/4_normalization.png" alt="Graph 2" style="height:360px">
								</center>
								<br>
								<p>
									Finally, the ENROLLMENTS table connects students and courses. The primary key is a composite of both columns:
								</p>
							</p>
							<center>
								<img src="../images/5_normalization.png" alt="Graph 2" style="height:360px">
							</center>
							<br>
							<p>
								These three tables meet the second normal form because all unnecessary redundancy has been eliminated.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Third Normal Form</b><br>
								<i>“A relation that is in first and second normal form and in which no non-primary-key attribute is transitively dependent on the primary key.” (Connolly & Begg, 2014: 472)</i>
							</p>
							<p>
								As there is no transitive dependency in these tables, they are already in third normal form and the exercise is complete.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Database Build Task</b><br>
							</p>
							<p>
								The second part of the task instructed us to design the appropriate database. For this, I use an application called QuickDBD (2023). The three tables are created with all of their rows and the respective data types. The primary keys are indicated by the key icons. Note that the relationships are all one-to-many relationships. Every Student can be enrolled in multiple classes and every class can contain multiple students.
							</p>
						</p>
						<center>
							<img src="../images/6_normalization.png" alt="Graph 2" style="height:360px">
						</center>
						<br>
						<p>
							The MySQL-code to create this database can conveniently be generated from this diagram (QuickDBD 2023) and looks like this:
						</p>
						<pre>
							<code>
CREATE TABLE `STUDENTS` (
    `StudentNumber` INT  NOT NULL ,
    `StudentName` VARCHAR(50)  NOT NULL ,
    `ExamScore` INT  NOT NULL ,
    `Support` BOOL  NOT NULL ,
    `Birthday` DATE  NOT NULL ,
    PRIMARY KEY (
        `StudentNumber`
    )
);

CREATE TABLE `COURSES` (
    `CourseName` VARCHAR(30)  NOT NULL ,
    `TeacherName` VARCHAR(50)  NOT NULL ,
    `ExamBoards` VARCHAR(10)  NOT NULL ,
    PRIMARY KEY (
        `CourseName`
    )
);

CREATE TABLE `ENROLLMENTS` (
    `StudentNumber` INT  NOT NULL ,
    `CourseName` VARCHAR(30)  NOT NULL ,
    PRIMARY KEY (
        `StudentNumber`,`CourseName`
    )
);

ALTER TABLE `ENROLLMENTS` ADD CONSTRAINT `fk_ENROLLMENTS_StudentNumber` FOREIGN KEY(`StudentNumber`)
REFERENCES `STUDENTS` (`StudentNumber`);

ALTER TABLE `ENROLLMENTS` ADD CONSTRAINT `fk_ENROLLMENTS_CourseName` FOREIGN KEY(`CourseName`)
REFERENCES `COURSES` (`CourseName`);
							</code>
						</pre>
						<p>
							<b>Conclusion</b><br>
						</p>
						<p>
							Practicing the normalization of databases is a useful activity to further the understanding of this challenging concept. However, as we were already required to design a normalized database for the group project last week, I feel like this exercise would have benefitted us more had we done it two weeks ago before actually being graded on the same activity. Still, this was an educational experience that will improve my understanding of database design for the second part of our group project.
