								<p> <b>[ Comment:</b> This assignment consisted of a three-week virtual discussion. All students had to present and criticize a company's code of conduct. We were then encouraged to reflect on various issues related to data protection. The following text is the graded 300-word summary of the discussion. Note that the names of other students were redacted for reasons of privacy. <b>]</b></p>


								<p> Discussing GDPR compliance in the context of organizations’ codes of conduct (CoC) demonstrated how complex data protection is. My peers and I all approached the issue from different directions. For example, one student examined data protection from a cyber security standpoint, someone else focused more on the skills and training of data scientists, and a third student proposed a licensing framework to encourage or sanction certain behaviors. I had originally approached the issue from a semantic perspective, criticizing the vague language of the GDPR and of SAP’s Guiding Principles for Artificial Intelligence (SAP 2021).	</p>

								<p> As this discussion revealed, more explicit regulations would not, however, fully solve the problems of data protection. Instead, they may lead to unfavorable consequences such as market centralization (Gal & Aviv 2020), product abandonment, or entrepreneurial discouragement (Martin et al. 2019). Also, data protection measures will only be as good as an organization’s overall security. During cyber attacks, such regulations only limit which data is available to criminals but not whether it is stolen. A strong balance must, therefore, be found between security and privacy, which can be conflicting goals (Cormack 2016). </p>

								<p> The main lesson from this discussion is that data protection must be addressed holistically. Many companies need to refine their CoC but they must also increase their cyber security and train their employees to understand GDPR requirements. Crucially, master data management and a rigorously enforced CRUD cycle (Profisee 2018) can help with controlling what data is collected, how it is stored, and who has access to it. </p>

								<p> We have learned that data protection is not merely addressed in CoCs. It needs to be part of a company’s work culture, business strategy, incident response plan, and more. At the most basic level, almost all major strategic decisions have the potential to affect data protection and privacy. </p>
