								<h3></h3>
								<p>After being encouraged to set up an ePortfolio, I admit to being skeptical at best. Blogs were never my thing and the difference between an ePortfolio and a blog eluded me. As I deepened my reading, however, I encountered more reasons to enthuse the idea.</p>
								<p>I learned that ePortfolios benefit students, educators, and employers alike. Students engage with the study material at a deeper level, which increases their academic performance (Ring et al., 2017). Educators can gauge how their students learn and not only what they learn (Banta, 2003). Finally, employers can get a better understanding of an applicantâ€™s skill set than a CV could ever convey. A survey revealed that "more than four in five employers say an electronic portfolio would be useful to them" (Hart Research Associates 2013). </p>
								<p>A fourth reason jumped out at me while researching another assignment. Deming and Noray (2019) found that STEM degrees tend to deflate in value. STEM majors have high wages initially but they also have much flatter wage growth compared to other groups. The reason is that technical skills become outdated more quickly than other types of experiences. </p>
								<p> I suppose one could somewhat counteract this effect by seeking out continuous education opportunities. An ePortfolio would demonstrate your professional growth even after graduation (Watty & McKay, 2015).</p>
								<p> While ePortfolios may not work for everyone (but what does?), I am excited to give it a try and see whether I can make them work for my own academic and professional goals. </p>
