								<h3>Beginning the Module (25 January 2023)</h3>
								<p>
									<p>This short post will explain my background and my expectations for this module. I hope to compare the module’s progress with these expectations to get a better understanding of my progress.
										I have a background in data analytics and statistics, so I am very familiar with data wrangling. I can use both R and Python for this purpose and have experience in generating data, cleaning it, merging it with other datasets, structuring it, and finally analyzing it. </p>
									<p>From this module, I hope to learn how to apply my existing skills to Big Data. Thus far, I have only worked with smaller datasets containing a few thousand rows. However, Big Data requires different tools, libraries, and processing strategies. I hope to gain insights into concepts such as batch processing or event stream processing. I also expect to learn theoretical models for data processing pipelines. Finally, I hope to learn from my professor and fellow students both about Big Data and beyond.
										A challenge I expect to face lies in the graded project. My previous experiences with group projects have been very mixed, so I am anxious about that part of the module. Luckily, there are ways to reduce freeriding, for example by randomizing assignments, as Swaray (2012) demonstrated, for example.</p>

								<h3>Peer Discussion - Initial Post (27 January 2023)</h3>
								<p>
									<p>Huxley (2020) discusses various ways of cleaning quantitative data and explains the statistical implications of various mathematical transformations. In the context of the Internet of Things (IoT), massive data streams lead to new challenges. Tejada (2023) describes how data from IoT devices is often processed in low-latency, high-volume environments. The Lambda and Kappa Architectures, for example, try to facilitate analysis by piping the data through a cold and hot path (batch layer vs. speed layer) simultaneously.</p>
									<p>While many data processing steps can be automated, machines will sometimes struggle with making appropriate decisions about cleaning and transformations. For example, Huxley (2020) explains how extreme values may result from collection errors, misrepresentations, faulty measuring equipment, or sampling errors. It often takes careful consideration and sometimes an active investigation to find the source of the error and know how to fix a particular data point. Unfortunately, manual or even semi-automated processes are impractical in the Big Data context (Gudivada et al. 2017).</p>
									<p>Luckily, Machine Learning can be used to distinguish between high- and low-quality data. For example, Wang et al (2020) proposed a “cleaning model” for wireless sensory 5G networks. The model was trained on reliable data and used to automate certain cleaning steps before allowing IoT sensory data to be uploaded to the cloud and used for further analysis.</p>
									<p>Also, I hypothesize that the sheer mass of data from IoT devices may partially mitigate cleaning issues. Faulty data is numerically insignificant against the enormous amount of other data points - at least as long as errors remain a rare exception. Whether the latter condition is met will, I expect, require careful manual analysis in most cases.</p>
