										<h2>Dynamics of State Sponsored Cyberattacks</h2>
										<p>Master's Thesis Project</p>
									</header>
									<p>As I wrote two master's theses on similar topics, this project description combines 
									both data analyses. Both papers
									were eventually published and can be read <a href="http://www.paxetbellum.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Fall-2020-Volume-7.pdf">here</a>
									and <a href="https://www.paxetbellum.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Pax-et-Bellum-Journal-2021_updated.pdf">here</a>.
									<br>
									My first thesis presented an examination of the dynamics of interstate cyber disputes. 
									More precisely, it explored which country-level factors will lead to a larger/smaller number of cyber 
									incidents involving that state. A number of different predictors for cyber disputes were tested using 
									negative binomial regression analysis. I had to combine several datasets to obtain all variables
									necessary for this analysis. The project was performed in R.<br>

									<br>
									The regression table shows the coefficients for three models. Initiations regresses the independent variables on the number of 
									cyberattacks a state is confirmed to have initiated.
									Victimizations regresses on the number of state sponsored cyberattacks a country has confirmedly suffered.
									Total Incidents combines both. I will not delve into the details of the model and variables in this ePortfolio.<br>
									Obviously, many cyberattacks are never made public and many observations in the data (which was country-year-based)
									contained no reported incident. Therefore, I controlled my findings by also running a zero-inflated negative binomial
									regression. Still, I was dealing with very limited and underreported data.<br>
									There are four main takeaways. First, more conventional military 
									strength also leads a state to be more frequently involved in cyber incidents. 
									Second, countries that are better connected to the internet employ cyber operations more 
									often but they are also more appealing targets. Third, having a highly educated population 
									makes countries more prone to using cyber tactics. Fourth, the dynamics of cyber disputes 
									differ significantly from those of more conventional conflicts.</p>
									<p>The second thesis explored the the Democratic and Capitalist Peace. These are a pair of theories based on the empirical observation
									That democracies never go to war with one another. The Democratic Peace theory states (and I am simplifying dramatically) that democracies
									view each other as legitimate and resolve their disputes with other democracies diplomatically. <br>
									By contrast, the Capitalist Peace theory argues that the observed peace between democratic countries is
									actually due to the fact that democratic countries are usually also economically liberal. This means that they
									tend to have closer economic ties and they lose our by fighting with each other. Therefore, peace between democracies
									is not due to their democratic regime characteristics but due to their economic systems.<br>
									I decided to test whether the underlying observation also holds true for Cyberattacks and not just conventional warfare.
									Thus, I replicated the statistical models used by Peace theorists but instead of using physical wars as the dependent
									variable, I used state-vs-state cyberattacks.<br>
									<img src="images/MA_Thesis_2_Logistic_Regression.jpg" alt="Regression Table 2" />
									<br>
									This table shows the results of a logistic regression, performed in R. Again, I combined data from a variety of sources
									in order to perform my analysis. I discovered two main conclusions: <br>
									First, democracy decreases the likelihood that two democratic states will experience cyber hostilities. 
									Similarly, more economic freedom will also reduce cyber conflict. 
									This suggests that both the democratic and the capitalist peace are observable in cyberspace.
									</p>
									<p>I hope you enjoyed this (admittedly somewhat superficial) explanation of my master's projects. 
									These were the first in-depth statistical analysis projects I have ever done. Despite a lot of self-doubt and anxiety 
									(which is normal in academia), both projects were a lot of fun and incredible learning opportunities.</p>
